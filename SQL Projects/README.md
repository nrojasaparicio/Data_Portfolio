# SQL Projects

- [**Analyzing CIA Factbook Data**](https://github.com/nrojasaparicio/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Projects/Analyzing%2BCIA%2BFactbook%2BData%2B(SQL)%20(1).ipynb)
  In this project, I analyze the CIA factbook using SQL and dive into investigating metrics such as migration rates, birth rates, and death rates for all the countries in the factbook.

- [**Chinook Business Analysis**](https://github.com/nrojasaparicio/Data_Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Projects/ChinookBusinessAnalysis.ipynb)
  As part of the Intermediate SQL for Data Analysis Dataquest course, I created this project where I had to conduct business analysis on the Chinook Record Store.
