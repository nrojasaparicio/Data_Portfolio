## About Me
Hi, all! I'm Nicole Rojas. I am currently an Operations Analyst for the Building Service 32BJ Health Fund where my responsibilities include reporting and creating Qlik dashboards on member health usage and staff productivity and serving as a liasion with the Data Engineering team on ETL processes used for our CRM. 

Through a data analytics bootcamp named COOP, I learned fundamental SQL and Tableau. After I finished this data bootcamp, I started teaching myself Python and boosting my SQL proficiency. In Fall 2021, I was selected to participate in the Data Science for All (DS4A) program by Correlation One where I was able to develop my Python skills and create an original Capstone project analyzing NYC motor vehicle accidents and transportation accessibility around the city incorporating analysis and modeling. I continue to develop my coding skills at work by reviewing SQL/Python code before it is pushed into production and using SQL to conduct analysis.
