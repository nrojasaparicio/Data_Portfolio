## About Me
Hi, all. I'm Nicole Rojas Aparicio. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science with a minor in Mandarin Chinese. After graduating, I decided to dive into data analytics/data science. Through a data analytics bootcamp named COOP, I learned SQL fundamentals and Tableau. After I finished this data bootcamp, I started self-teaching myself Python and boosting my SQL skills.
