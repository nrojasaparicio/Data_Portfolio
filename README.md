## About Me
Hi, all! I'm Nicole Rojas-Aparicio. I decided to dive into data analytics/data science. Through a data analytics bootcamp named COOP, I learned SQL fundamentals and Tableau. After I finished this data bootcamp, I started self-teaching myself Python and boosting my SQL proficiency. In Fall 2021, I was selected to participate in the Data Science for All (DS4A) program by Correlation One where I was able to develop my Python skills and incorporate this in machine learning and a create an original Capstone project analyzing NYC motor vehicle accidents and transportation accessibility around the city.
